Project

For the Restaurant Reviews projects, students have to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One students will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker should also be added.

Dependencies

Starter code is provided by Udacity. This project uses leafletjs with Mapbox.
